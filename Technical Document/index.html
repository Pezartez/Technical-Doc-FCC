      <p>This is a technical document for people who love to code and also want to learn how to knit. Yes, it is an odd
        document, but it is just for fun and practice - so anything goes!</p>
      <p>Knitting is similar to coding in a few ways.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Something beautiful is build, piece by piece</li>
        <li>It takes great attention to detail</li>
        <li>It is a great stress reliever!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Getting_Started">
      <header>Getting Started</header>
      <p>You don't need much to get started, and supplies can be found at many familiar stores. Your first set of
        knitting needles does not have to be fancy, just get an average-sized circular needle. This will be able to
        handle most beginning projects.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to pick out some fun, medium-guage yarn. Although it might be tempting to buy very cheap yarn,
        spending a little extra money makes the experience so much more enjoyable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Big Box stores are good in a pinch, but try exploring some locally owned shops!</li>
        <li>Knitting or crafting clubs (like the Arts and Crafts Club of Suwanee) can be a great way to start out - we
          love to share our craft!</li>
      </ul>
      <code>Local stores near Suwanee, GA include: <a href="https://ecofriendlycrafts.com/">EcoFriendly Crafts</a>.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Ways_To_Learn">
      <header>Ways To Learn</header>
      <p>There are lots of ways to learn! I am mostly self-taught and watched YouTube videos to learn. You could also go
        to a local library and pick up a "how to" book, although it is a little hard for beginners to understand the
        pictures in these books.</p>
      <p>As mentioned in the above section, a knitting club is another way to learn. Crafting stores often host special
        classes to help beginners learn as well.</p>
      <p>
        <code>Making things for someone is a great way to stay motivated when you are first learning. It can be frustrating at first, but if you stick it out there are many rewards!</code>

      <header>It's A Journey</header>
      <p>Just like when you are learning to code, knitting takes a lot of practice! Think about the first time you
        edited HTML, you've probably come a long way since the first time you inserted a special font on your MySpace
        page!</p>
      <p>Remember this!?</p>
      <code>img src="cool image url"</code>
      <p>When reading a pattern, look out for these common "short-hands":</p>
      <code>K = Knit  //  K2Tog = Knit Two Together
            P = Purl </code>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Potential_Projects">
      <header>Potential Projects</header>
      <p>It's best to start easy, learn how to knit and purl. After that, the possibilities are endless!</p>
      <p>
        <code>Stockinette stitch, Garter Stitch, Moss stitch and many others only use combinations of Knit and Purl stitches</code>
      <p>Most intricate patterns are combinations of Knitting, Purling, Cabling and stitching more than one stitch (or
        half a stitch) each time. It can get a little complicated, but as long as you take it one stitch at a time, pay
        attention to details and remember to relax, you will be making beautiful pieces before you know it!</p>
